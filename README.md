# Wine-Quality-Classification

This repository contains the jupyter notebook used to conduct an analysis of wine quality. The data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009) however, originate from a research paper by [Cortez et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167923609001377) and relate to the red wine variant of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.

This analysis includes initial data exploration, examining how the data are distributed and how the variables relate to one another before data cleaning and pre-processing is conducted and three classification models are fitted. The analysis aims to assess the preformance of each of the three classifiers at predicting whether each wine observation is classed as "Good"/ "Higher" quality or "Bad"/ "Lower" quality based on physicochemical (input) variables.
